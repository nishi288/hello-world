# hello-world
This is my First Repository!!!

This will be my introduction to the GitHub profile.
I will be designing an introduction page with the help of Angular JS to portray my academic career and technical skills.
This is a great way to start building my profile and showcasing my interest to coding as well as gaining technical skills.
Best Luck to myself to start building my profile from June,2018 till June,2019.
